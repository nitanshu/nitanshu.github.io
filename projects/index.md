## Projects

###NoteApp(AngularJS and Rails)

This project is build on a thought of storing the notes of a user just by typing his/her email id and if he/she is already signed up then they can see all the notes they saved earlier if not they can start creating one.

###Blogging App(Rails)

This is a blogging app not so much to say about this project it keeps the track of blogs which is so simple but follows rails convention.

###Sample App(Rails)

This is also a testing app build while I was learning rails with the help of a book(M.hartl). It is test-driven development and tells every inch of rails for beginners.
