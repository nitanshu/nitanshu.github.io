##Valid Email Regex

Regular Expression created for checking whether the email is valid or not it is supported by google.

I tried writing a perfect email regex which can be supported for almost every standard website like google, facebook etc.

  {% raw %}
    \A[a-zA-Z0-9]*[\.?*[a-zA-Z0-9]]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+){1,3}\z
  {% endraw %}
